# creating-more-objects-literals

here you can see another object again it is called hotel but this time the model represents a different hotel for a moment imagine that this is a different page of the same travel website

the park hotel is larger it has 120 rooms and 77 of them are booked
the only things changing in the code are the values of the hotel object's properties:
.the name of the hotel
.how many roms are booked

the rest of the code work the same as the other example previously i showed on the file at my github "creating-objects-using-literal-notation"
